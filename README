FILES:
osm.c -- a file with the code implementation of the header file osm.h.
makefile -- Running make with no arguments will generate the
            libosm.a library.


REMARKS:


Assignment 1:
first, the program creates a directory names "welcome" with mode 0775.
then it opens another directory named "To" inside the "welcome" directory.
we return a file descriptor of "Welcome/To/OS2018" with the flags O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC.
we get the status of the file.

writes up to 82 bytes from the buffer pointed buf to the file referred to by
the file descriptor fd = 3.

we used close() that closes  a  file  descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any
file and may be reused.
we delete  the name "Welcome/To/OS2018" from the filesystem.
we delete the directory "Welcome/To/", [which is (as it must be) empty], and "Welcome/".
we finished by terminating not only the calling thread, but all threads in the calling
process's thread group.
